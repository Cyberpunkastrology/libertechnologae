Fuck around and find out.
That is the extent of the law.

“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magick.”
-Arthur c. Clark

Like all the other forms of magick that technomancy is built upon, of, and from, basic principles apply, like The law of threefold return. Any energy you put into the universe comes back with three times as much energy. It’s more nuanced than good and bad- when you are selfish, the universe acts accordingly. When you act fearfully, the universe gives you something to be scared of.
If you’ve studied mysticism as I have, you’ll realize that magick a powerful psychological tool for self discovery, self improvement, and self mastery. ’as above, so below’ as the old adage goes… but also, ‘as within, so without’. Mastering yourself (which is no more complicated than learning how to use the controller) is a prerequisite to mastering any form of magick.
Technomancy is no different, it just uses the tools available to us at the start of a new millennium. Those who survive the COVID-19 pandemic are being called upon to build a new golden age for humanity. Not all of us will make it to this promised land, but we owe it to each other, to all humans past, present, and future, to do the work we are each individually called to do.

Technomancy is practiced worldwide– like magick in general, most people don’t know they’re doing it. This is a guide to using technomancy to accomplish your goals, improve your soul, and use techniques in the world outside the dimension of cyberspace to create a world worth living in.

The internet, described without context, fits right in to mystical concepts like telepathy, conjuring, and as I’ll discuss further in the section on Defense Against The Dark Arts, Mind Control and Energetic Slavery. 

Mindfulness and self awareness are vital to your experience in the third dimension in the Cathartic Human Avatar Open Source project, or CHAOS [beta]. Your parental unit likely installed a basic operating system, though these piscean age programs are buggy at best. The good news is, you are free to write and run your own programs, and share the best ones with the community. Though attribution is a best practice when possible, it is not required under POSL, the Palladian Open Source License.

Most technomancers fall into one of three categories, but the truth is that all three energies exist in everyone. Those three categories, according to Robert X. Cringely in their book Accidental Empires, are as follows:

“Forget about the first subspecies, the lumpenprogrammers, who typically spend their careers maintaining mainframe computer code at insurance companies. Lumpenprogrammers don’t even like to program but have discovered that by the simple technique of leaving out the comments—clues, labels, and directions written in English—they are supposed to sprinkle in among their lines of computer code, their programs are rendered undecipherable by others, guaranteeing them a lifetime of dull employment.

The two programmer subspecies that are worthy of note are the hippies and the nerds. Nearly all great programmers are one type or the other. Hippy programmers have long hair and deliberately, even pridefully, ignore the seasons in their choice of clothing. They wear shorts and sandals in the winter and T-shirts all the time. Nerds are neat little anal-retentive men with penchants for short-sleeved shirts and pocket protectors. Nerds carry calculators; hippies borrow calculators. Nerds use decongestant nasal sprays; hippies snort cocaine. Nerds typically know forty-six different ways to make love but don’t know any women.”

The path you take is yours alone to choose. Remember that no single effort is ever permanently sufficient, and that a gilded cage is still a cage. The mindset of the lumpenprogrammer is completely rational coming from a place of scarcity. This was a hallmark of the piscean age, as are hierarchy, subjugation and abuse of power.

The good news is, those days are over. We entered the Age of Aquarius in December of 2020 or March of 2021 depending on your math. It’s less like a light switch and more like a tide that’s been coming in since the 1960’s, though it started earlier than that. For those reading this in the era it was written, we were born at the end of the age of fuck around, and the beginning of the age of find out.

Aquarian Magick is inherently personal, and what works for one person might not work for another, or anyone else for that matter. That being the case, do not attempt to recreate someone else's magick - use it as a template to develop your own.

Obviously there are still piscean structures that don’t resonate with this frequency. Destruction is an inherently creative act, but ought to be done as mindfully as possible in order to reduce unnecessary suffering. This

May this book, with the highest vibrations from you, your spirit guides, and your highest self, help you achieve your greatest good.

Blessings to, and from, your soul family.

-James
